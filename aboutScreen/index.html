        Hello there! I'm an ambitious 19-year-old software engineer hailing from
        Brazil, equipped with a diverse skill set encompassing both back-end and
        front-end programming. My journey into the world of technology began
        while in high school, where I undertook a development course named
        CRIE_TI at the esteemed Brazilian university, Univates. This educational
        endeavor laid the foundation for my proficiency in the intricacies of
        coding.

        Reflecting on my professional journey, the snippet from my portfolio
        showcases my tenure at Minuano Alimentos as an Administrative Assistant.
        This experience, highlighted by effective time management and teamwork,
        contributes to my well-rounded skill set as a software engineer. It's
        not just about lines of code; it's about understanding the broader
        context and seamlessly integrating into dynamic work environments.
